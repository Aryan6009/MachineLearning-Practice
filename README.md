# MachineLearning-Practice

This repository contains my **machine learning practice work** while learning core ML concepts using **Python**.  
It includes implementations of common algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation methods.

The objective of this project is to **build a strong foundation through hands-on coding** and maintain a clear record of learning progress.
