This repository contains my machine learning practice work and experiments while learning core ML concepts using Python.
It includes implementations of commonly used algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation methods.

The purpose of this repository is to build a strong foundation in machine learning through hands-on coding and to maintain a clear record of my learning progress.
